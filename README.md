**Object-Oriented Programming Assignment
📖 Overview**

This project contains two activities that demonstrate OOP concepts in Python:

Assignment 1 – Design Your Own Class

Activity 2 – Polymorphism Challenge

**🏗️ Assignment 1: Design Your Own Class**

A Smartphone class is created with attributes (brand, model, storage) and methods (show_details(), make_call()).

A subclass Smartphone5G inherits from Smartphone and adds a new method browse_internet().

This demonstrates constructors, attributes, methods, inheritance, and encapsulation.

Example Output:

📱 Samsung Galaxy S22 with 128GB storage.
📞 Calling 0712345678 from Galaxy S22...
📱 Apple iPhone 14 Pro with 256GB storage.
📞 Calling 0798765432 from iPhone 14 Pro...
🌐 Browsing at 1000 Mbps on iPhone 14 Pro.

**🎭 Activity 2: Polymorphism Challenge**

A base class Vehicle is created with a method move().

Subclasses (Car, Plane, Boat) override move() with different behaviors.

This demonstrates polymorphism, as each class defines its own version of the same method.

Example Output:

🚗 Driving on the road...
✈️ Flying in the sky...
⛵ Sailing on the water...
